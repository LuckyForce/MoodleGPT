- Sometimes there won't be a question, so just answer the statement as you normally would without following the other rules and give the most detailled and complete answer with explication.

- You will keep the same order for the answers like in the text. 
- You will separate all the answer with new lines and only show the correctes one.
- You will only give the answers for each question and omit the questions, statement, title or other informations from the response.
